# Word-Guess-Game

The Word-Guess-Game is based on a list of shows from Netflix that I've seen recently. As soon as the user types a letter after the screen loads, the game begins. Once a turn is over, the next word off the list is used, and a new turn begins. The game ends when all words have been used, at which time an alert is displayed noting that all the words were played.
